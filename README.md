# AVIS-Sentramind

**AVIS** is an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant monitoring platform that provides unified visibility into Zabbix alerts, Veeam backup infrastructure, and system health metrics. It delivers centralized monitoring through role-based dashboards, enhanced with AI-powered insights to help teams quickly understand system status, identify issues, and make informed decisions. The platform also generates automated daily, weekly, and monthly reports distributed via email, and sends real-time alert notifications through Telegram to ensure timely awareness and response.

## Problem & Objective

Modern IT teams operate complex infrastructure across multiple monitoring and backup systems, which often leads to fragmented visibility, delayed responses, and manual reporting overhead. **AVIS** addresses this challenge by consolidating monitoring data from Zabbix and Veeam into a single, centralized platform. It provides role-based dashboards, intelligent alerting with real-time Telegram notifications, and automated daily, weekly, and monthly reporting via email, supported by AI-assisted insights to help teams maintain visibility, respond faster to issues, and make informed operational decisions.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or bun package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SentramindAI/AVIS-portal.git
cd AVIS-portal

# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
bun install
```

---

## Running Locally

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
# or
bun dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

---

## Keycloak Admin API (Local)

Super Admin Organizations and member management use a local Deno API at `src/keycloak/admin-api/index.ts`, proxied by Vite from `/api/keycloak/*` to `http://localhost:8000`.

### 1) Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or merge values into your existing `.env`) and set:

- `KEYCLOAK_BASE_URL` (required)
- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_ID` (required)
- `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET` (required)
- `KEYCLOAK_REALM` (optional, defaults to `Jarvis`)
- `PORT` (optional, defaults to `8000`)

If required variables are missing/invalid, the admin API now returns:

- HTTP `503`
- JSON body with actionable fields: `error`, `missing`, `invalid`

### 2) Run admin API

From repo root:

```bash
deno run -A src/keycloak/admin-api/index.ts
```

### 3) Run frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite serves on `http://localhost:8082` in this repo and proxies `/api/keycloak/*` to the Deno admin API.

## External Integrations

The application integrates with external monitoring systems via webhooks:

| Integration | Endpoint Purpose |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Veeam Alarms | Fetches backup and replication alarm data |
| Veeam Infrastructure | Fetches VM infrastructure details |
| Zabbix Alerts | Fetches Zabbix Problems and other details |
| Zabbix Hosts | Fetches Zabbix hosts and there details |

---

## Current Status

**In Development** — The frontend application is feature-complete for core monitoring workflows. Backend integration via webhooks is functional for Veeam data sources. Full Zabbix integration and authentication are pending backend implementation.
